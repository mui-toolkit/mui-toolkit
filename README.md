## Project Challenges
- Managing the number of props + state of the custom theme object throughout our application — more than four dozen parameters! 
- Assigning the logic of change handlers to different selection tools within the design page
- Learning the functionality of a NoSQL database (Firestore), and the referencing of deeply nested objects
- Firebase data flow, integration of Firebase + Google Cloud functions, and how authentication interacts with database
- Implementing drag and drop functionality with vanilla Javascript rather than a library, and gaining an understanding of how implementation works under the hood
- Building social aspects ie. starring and bookmarking themes — capturing and storing interactions between users 

## Learning Takeaways
- System design and optimization of queries is essential to final user experience
- Prop threading and state management can be daunting in larger React applications
- Understanding the importance and implementation of UI frameworks with repsect to the final user experience
- Run into a problem? There's probably a library for that (but the documentation isn't always great!)
